## Ideas for game

- Use probably don't know as a forest theme
- Use backpack on your back as an indoor theme
- Find a way to parse and make it so one character has one large sprite sheet.
- Turn behavior into callable objects such as move and those get set up in the constructor.
- Make a behavior class and have all method objects callable. Then just have a list in the sprite that calls them with a sprite reference and have them figure out what to do with the sprite.
- On animation animate is now play!
- Make it so any difficult fight has cheese for those who want to be sneaky or solve a puzzle or do something an unintended way.
- Holly the fey witch
- Make a Parry system for the shield
- Implement the layers to be drawn as a stack. Care Danes of BYU administration said so in a dream. Met Mr a game in the elevator. Show him the game when it's done. Also show it to Maren when it's done.
- Also do not forget to go to the temple. Do a Spanish session there.
- Use a sped up RCA theme to do triumph sound effects.
- Add combo attacks
- Add dual weapon special attacks
- Check for input held and when it's not held reset the ability to press the button!
- Holly the fairy witch doesn't have weapons, her wand can take a weapon and turn it into a spell. therefore her inventory works differently and she can't carry anything that is not in her hands.
- Larry can run and jump and stuff, Holly moves at a fast pace always and therefore may be more chaotic to control.

## RCA Story

He's out for blood. But you know....he's also there for a good time.

Larry the blacksmith just wanted a quiet life. Is that too much to ask? But noooo, some idiot village elder just had to go get involved in politics! Well now he's drawn down the ire of the dragons. Ruoken descended upon the village demanding gold under threat of fire. Larry would have just paid the dragon but the elder wanted to be a hero. 

Now the elder is a charred pile of ash and Larry, who just happened to look like the biggest guy in town even though he wasn't technically, was taken by the dragon to send a message. Meanwhile the village is going up in flames in the distance while the dragon carries Larry away to certain death. 

Or is he? Not knowing and not wanting to find out, Larry stomps Ruoken a good one on the toe with the slag hammer he happened to be holding. It would be incorrect to say that it hurt the dragon but it surprised him enough that he let go. 

Falling to his certain demise, Larry supposes that, while he couldn't save his village, he would avenge it if he had just one more chance...

... And you know what? It would seem fate is giving him that chance. Waking up bruised and sore but miraculously unharmed in the meadows of red Castle valley, Larry begins his quest to become the legendary Red Castle Avenger!

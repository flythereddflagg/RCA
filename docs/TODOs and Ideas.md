- Plan out game now
- Make two subsets of the same group of Sprites make one for drawing and one for interactions
- Map a complete list of what a Sprite can do. Use this map to translate buttons into actions.
- Use probably don't know as a forest theme
- Use backpack on your back as an indoor theme
- Point exit trigger Sprites to one another and have them figure out where the character goes.
- Reformat scenes to have layers and a separate class for a scene?
- Find a way to parse and make it so one character has one large sprite sheet.
- Make an animation class that automatically figures out the player's next frame. This separates duties.
- Restructure all Sprites to be simpler and have fewer inheritances.
